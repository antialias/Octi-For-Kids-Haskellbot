to play, just type 

./ofk.exe

The defaulte mode is for the human to move first, then the computer
will think three moves ahead and make it's move. The cycle will
continue until a winner prevails. 

You can set differnt play modes with

./ofk.exe players=<player 1 options>:<player 2 options>

Player options are as follows:

h  =  human player
w  =  prompt for move as webpage and stop execution (only usefull for CGI)
cX =  computer move where X is the number of moves to look ahead


Other options are as follows:

move=<move in Thomas Hallock's OCTI for Kits notation>
board=<board expressed as Haskell tuples and lists see Ofk.hs for info>
-cgi=<regular arguments list escaped as UCF-8 characters>


The bot may be set up quite easily to run as a CGI application. Just
place the files "ofk.exe" and "fcgi" into a cgi-bin folder and type: 

chmod 0755 fcgi
chown nobody fcgi
